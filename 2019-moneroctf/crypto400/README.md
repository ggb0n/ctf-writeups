# crypto400

Hey there, super sleuth. The research team is looking for some help,
since we're pretty busy with the DEF CON village. Apparently some no-goodniks
are planning a big heist on one of the most famous fictional casinos
in history, but nobody knows which one.

If you're up for the challenge, help us out! Oh, and don't worry
about any complicated codebase for this. I know SarangNoether
keeps some Python tools in a repo for just such an occasion.
